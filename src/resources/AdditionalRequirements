Additional Requirements for Part I and Part II :

Your program must read input from files located in a directory called "resources". 
Make sure to use relative path instead of specifying the entire path (such as /Users/alicew/myworkspace/so_on_and_so_forth).

If the first exact match is found, stop fromfindSubset() and print it out. If there is no exact match found, 
go through all combination of sublists and print out the first closest match.

Show enough runs to prove your algorithm works, and show at least one run that does not meet target, exactly.
Also, provide a special test to quickly dispose of the case in which the target is larger than the sum of all elements in the master set. 
This way, any target that is too large will not have to sit through a long and painful algorithm. 
Demonstrate that this works by providing at least one run that seeks a target larger than the sum of all master set elements.
Modify the test file to include additional test cases.
